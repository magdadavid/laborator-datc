Google Apps

Google long ago expanded beyond its search and advertising roots to offer businesses a comprehensive suite of productivity tools. Google Apps includes custom professional email (complete with spam protection), shared calendars and video meetings alongside Google Drive. 
A cloud-based document storage solution, Google Drive enables staffers to access files from any device and share them instantly with colleagues, in the process eliminating email attachments as well as the hassles of merging different versions.
